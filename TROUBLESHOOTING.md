# HealthConnect - Troubleshooting Guide

## üîß Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Backend Won't Start - PostConstruct Error

**Error:** `package javax.annotation does not exist`

**Solution:** This was fixed! The annotation was changed from `javax.annotation.PostConstruct` to `jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct` for Spring Boot 3.x compatibility.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

### Issue 2: Lombok Warnings in IDE

**Symptom:** You see Lombok-related warnings in VS Code

**Solution:** These are IDE warnings only and won't affect compilation. To ignore them:
1. The project will compile and run fine with Maven
2. Lombok generates getters/setters/constructors at compile time
3. IDE warnings can be ignored

---

### Issue 3: Port Already in Use

**Error:** Port 8080 or 3000 already in use

**Solution for Port 8080 (Backend):**
```powershell
# Find the process
netstat -ano | findstr :8080

# Kill it (replace PID with actual number)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

**Solution for Port 3000 (Frontend):**
```powershell
# Find the process
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Kill it (replace PID with actual number)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

### Issue 4: Maven Build Fails

**Solution:**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\shame\Desktop\Project App\HealthConnect\server"

# Clean and rebuild
mvn clean install

# If still failing, skip tests
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

---

### Issue 5: npm Install Fails

**Solution:**
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\shame\Desktop\Project App\HealthConnect\client"

# Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules
Remove-Item -Force package-lock.json

# Reinstall
npm install
```

### Issue 6: CORS Errors in Browser

**Symptom:** "Access to XMLHttpRequest blocked by CORS policy"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure backend is running on port 8080
2. Make sure frontend is running on port 3000
3. Check `CorsConfig.java` allows `http://localhost:3000`
4. Clear browser cache and try again

---

### Issue 7: Blank Page or React Errors

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Clear cache and rebuild
cd "C:\Users\shame\Desktop\Project App\HealthConnect\client"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules/.cache
npm start
```

---

### Issue 8: Data Not Persisting

**Expected Behavior:** This is normal! The application uses in-memory storage.

**What This Means:**
- Data is lost when you restart the backend
- Sample data is reloaded on each start
- This is by design for this college project

---

### Issue 9: Can't Login with Test Credentials

**Solution:**
1. Make sure backend server is running
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Try these exact credentials:

**Doctor:**
- Email: `sarah.johnson@health.com`
- Password: `doctor123`

**Patient:**
- Email: `john.smith@email.com`
- Password: `patient123`

---

### Issue 10: API Returns 404

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Backend server is running (check terminal)
- [ ] URL is correct: `http://localhost:8080/api/...`
- [ ] Check for typos in endpoint path
- [ ] Review browser Network tab (F12)

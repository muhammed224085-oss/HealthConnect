# Frontend Error Fix - "Cannot read properties of undefined"

## Issue
When booking appointments in the Patient Dashboard, the application was throwing an error:
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')
```

## Root Cause
After upgrading the backend to use String IDs (to match MongoDB requirements), the frontend was still trying to parse doctor IDs as integers:

```javascript
// OLD CODE - BROKEN
const selectedDoctor = doctors.find(d => d.id === parseInt(appointmentForm.doctorId));
```

This caused `selectedDoctor` to be `undefined` when no doctor was found with the matching integer ID, leading to the error when trying to access `selectedDoctor.id`.

## Fix Applied

### File: `client/src/pages/PatientDashboard.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
const handleAppointmentSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  const selectedDoctor = doctors.find(d => d.id === parseInt(appointmentForm.doctorId));
  
  const appointmentData = {
    patientId: user.id,
    doctorId: selectedDoctor.id,  // ❌ Error if selectedDoctor is undefined
    // ... rest of the data
  };
  // ...
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const handleAppointmentSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  // Compare as both string and number for compatibility
  const selectedDoctor = doctors.find(d => 
    d.id === appointmentForm.doctorId || 
    d.id === parseInt(appointmentForm.doctorId)
  );
  
  // ✅ Check if doctor was found
  if (!selectedDoctor) {
    alert('Please select a valid doctor');
    return;
  }
  
  const appointmentData = {
    patientId: user.id,
    doctorId: selectedDoctor.id,  // ✅ Safe to access now
    // ... rest of the data
  };
  // ...
};
```

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Prevents Undefined Errors**: Checks if doctor exists before accessing properties
2. **Better User Experience**: Shows clear error message if doctor selection is invalid
3. **ID Type Compatibility**: Works with both String and Number IDs
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Prevents application crash

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Restart the frontend server (it should auto-reload)
2. Login as a patient
3. Try to book an appointment
4. Select a doctor and fill in the details
5. Submit the form
6. Appointment should be created successfully

## Next Steps

If you encounter the error again:
1. Clear your browser's localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Refresh the page
3. Login again with sample credentials
